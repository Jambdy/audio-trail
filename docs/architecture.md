# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The Audio Trail application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. The application uses Firebase as its backend platform for data storage, authentication, and cloud services.

The frontend flutter app will be in the frontend folder.

## Core Architecture Components

### Backend Services (Firebase)
- **Firebase Authentication**
  - User registration and login
  - Social authentication providers
  - Secure token management
  - User session handling

- **Cloud Firestore**
  - NoSQL database for app data
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Offline data persistence
  - Scalable data structure

- **Firebase Storage**
  - Audio file storage
  - User content storage
  - Secure file access control
  - Efficient media delivery

- **Firebase Cloud Functions** (if needed)
  - Serverless backend operations
  - API integrations
  - Background tasks
  - Data processing

### MVVM Pattern
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic layer
  - Data models
  - Repository classes
  - Service classes
  
- **View**: UI components that display data and handle user interactions
  - Flutter widgets
  - Screen layouts
  - UI components
  
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between Model and View
  - Handles UI logic
  - Manages state
  - Processes user actions
  - Formats data for display

### State Management
Riverpod is used as the primary state management solution:
- Provider pattern for dependency injection
- StateNotifier for mutable state
- ConsumerWidget for reactive UI updates
- Family providers for parameterized state

### Navigation
Go Router handles the application's routing and navigation:
- Declarative routing configuration
- Deep linking support
- Path-based navigation
- Route guards for authentication
- Nested navigation support

## Dependencies
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management
- `go_router`: Navigation
- `firebase_core`: Firebase core functionality
- `firebase_auth`: Authentication services
- `cloud_firestore`: NoSQL database
- `firebase_storage`: File storage
- Other dependencies will be added as needed for specific features

## Firebase Configuration
The application requires proper Firebase configuration:
- Firebase project setup in Firebase Console
- Platform-specific configuration files
  - `google-services.json` for Android
  - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
- Security rules configuration for Firestore and Storage
- Authentication providers setup
