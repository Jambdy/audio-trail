# Development Instructions

## Development Process
The Audio Trail application will be developed in clear, documented milestones. Each milestone represents a specific feature or set of features that will be implemented and reviewed before moving to the next phase. Each milestone will have a separate plan document in the docs/milestones folder. The milestone plan will be reviewed by the user before implementation begins.

## Agent Checkpoints
At the end of each milestone:
1. The agent will review the implemented code
2. Verify that all acceptance criteria are met
3. Ensure proper test coverage
4. Check code quality and adherence to best practices
5. Provide feedback and suggestions for improvements
6. Only proceed to the next milestone after approval
